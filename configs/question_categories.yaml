# Rubric focus guidelines by category
rubric_focus_guidelines:
  hierarchical-agents:
    primary: ["coverage", "detail_specificity"]
    secondary: ["structure_coherence"]
    rationale: "Technical complexity requires comprehensive coverage and specific implementation details"
    
  supabase-sql:
    primary: ["detail_specificity", "structure_coherence"]
    secondary: ["coverage"]
    rationale: "Database work needs precise details and well-organized presentation"
    
  general-writing:
    primary: ["style_tone", "structure_coherence"]
    secondary: ["coverage"]
    rationale: "Writing quality and organization are paramount for communication effectiveness"

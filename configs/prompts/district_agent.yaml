      Please create comprehensive district-level narratives that provide strategic insights for superintendent and board leadership:
      
      1. **District Strengths** (2-3 bullet points): Clear, specific areas where the district excels
      2. **District Needs** (2-3 bullet points): Priority areas requiring strategic attention and resources
      3. **Executive Summary** (1-2 paragraphs): Concise overview for board presentation - under 150 words
      4. **Recommended PD Strategy** (3-5 items): Strategic professional development initiatives
      5. **Board Stories** (2-4 items): Data-backed stories ready for board communication
      6. **Celebration Opportunities** (2-3 items): Success stories and recognition opportunities
      7. **Resource Priorities** (2-4 items): Strategic resource allocation recommendations
      
      Guidelines:
      - Focus on system-level strategic insights, not individual school details
      - Use data to support all recommendations and narratives
      - Balance recognition of strengths with honest assessment of needs
      - Provide actionable, strategic recommendations appropriate for superintendent/board level
      - Use professional, executive-level language
      - Ensure board stories include supporting data and clear calls to action when appropriate

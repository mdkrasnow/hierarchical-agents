    description: "Synthesize evidence-backed narratives for teacher performance"
    template: |
      You are creating comprehensive narratives for a teacher based on multiple evaluations.
      
      Teacher: $teacher_name
      Number of Evaluations: $evaluation_count
      
      Domain Analysis:
      $domain_analysis
      
      Risk Assessment:
      $risk_analysis
      
      Professional Development Recommendations:
      $pd_recommendations
      
      Key Evidence:
      $evidence_highlights
      
      Please create three evidence-backed narratives:
      
      1. **Growth Story** (2-3 sentences highlighting strengths and positive trends)
      2. **Concern Story** (2-3 sentences addressing areas needing attention, if any)
      3. **Overall Summary** (1-2 sentences for quick overview - under 40 words)
      
      Guidelines:
      - Base all statements on the provided evidence and analysis
      - Be specific and actionable, not generic
      - Use positive, professional language even when addressing concerns
      - Focus on observable teaching behaviors and student impact
      - If no concerns exist, the concern story can be null

        "growth_story": "Evidence-backed positive narrative highlighting teacher strengths...",
        "concern_story": "Professional narrative addressing development areas..." or null,

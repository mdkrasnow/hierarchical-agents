      You are analyzing a Danielson evaluation domain for evidence-based insights.
      
      Domain: $domain_id ($domain_name)
      Score: $domain_score
      
      Evaluation Notes:
      $domain_notes
      
      Please analyze this domain and provide:
      
      1. Key strengths demonstrated (specific evidence)
      2. Areas for growth (actionable concerns)  
      3. Evidence quotes (direct quotes from notes)
      4. Growth signals (positive indicators)
      5. Concern signals (areas needing attention)
      
      Format your response as JSON:

  - name: risk_detection
    description: "Detect burnout, disengagement, and leaving risk signals"
    template: |
      You are analyzing teacher evaluation text to detect risk signals.
      
      Evaluation Text:
      $evaluation_text
      
      Please analyze this text for indicators of:
      
      1. **Burnout signals**: Overwhelm, stress, emotional exhaustion
      2. **Disengagement signals**: Lack of enthusiasm, going through motions
      3. **Leaving risk**: Considering career change, job dissatisfaction
      
      For each category, provide:
      - Specific evidence from the text (direct quotes)
      - Severity level (low/medium/high)
      - Contextual explanation
      
      Format as JSON:
      {
        "burnout": {
          "indicators": ["evidence1", "evidence2"],
          "severity": "low|medium|high",
          "context": "Brief explanation"
        },
        "disengagement": {
          "indicators": ["evidence1", "evidence2"], 
          "severity": "low|medium|high",

          "severity": "low|medium|high", 
          "context": "Brief explanation"
        },
        "confidence_score": 0.8
      }
      
      Be conservative - only flag clear indicators, not normal challenges.

  - name: evidence_extraction
    description: "Extract key evidence snippets from evaluation text"
    template: |
      You are extracting key evidence from a teacher evaluation.
      
      Evaluation Content:
      $evaluation_content
      
      Please extract the most important evidence snippets that demonstrate:
      
      1. **Teaching practices** (what the teacher did)
      2. **Student responses** (how students reacted/engaged)
      3. **Learning environment** (classroom culture/management)
      4. **Professional behaviors** (preparation, reflection, growth)
      
      Guidelines:
      - Focus on specific, observable behaviors
      - Include direct quotes when possible
      - Prioritize evidence that shows impact on learning
      - Limit to top 10 most significant pieces

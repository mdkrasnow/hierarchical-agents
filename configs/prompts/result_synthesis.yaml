  # Result Synthesis

  ## Objective
  Synthesize and consolidate the following results from multiple agents into a unified, coherent response.

  ## Agent Results to Synthesize
  $agent_results

  ## Synthesis Instructions
  $synthesis_instructions

  ## Required Analysis
  Please provide:

  ### 1. Consensus Areas
  - Identify areas where agents agree
  - Highlight common findings and recommendations
  - Note consistent patterns across responses

  ### 2. Conflicts and Disagreements
  - Point out where agents disagree or contradict each other
  - Analyze potential reasons for disagreements
  - Suggest resolution approaches where possible

  ### 3. Unified Recommendations
  - Provide consolidated recommendations that account for all agent inputs
  - Prioritize recommendations based on agent consensus and evidence strength
  - Address any conflicting recommendations with clear reasoning

  ### 4. Information Gaps
  - Identify areas where information is missing or incomplete
  - Note questions that need further investigation
  - Suggest what additional analysis might be needed

  ## Output Requirements
  $output_format

  ## Quality Criteria
  $quality_criteria

  ## Confidence Assessment
  For each major finding or recommendation, provide a confidence level (High/Medium/Low) based on:
  - Agreement level among agents
  - Quality of supporting evidence
  - Complexity and uncertainty of the domain

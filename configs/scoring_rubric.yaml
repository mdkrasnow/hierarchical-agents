# Scoring Methodology
scoring_methodology:
  calculation: "weighted_average"
  formula: "sum(dimension_score * dimension_weight / 100) for all dimensions"
  rounding: "round_to_nearest_integer"
  minimum_score: 0
  maximum_score: 100

# Evaluation Guidelines
evaluation_guidelines:
  factual_correctness_weight: 0
  factual_correctness_note: "Factual correctness is explicitly de-emphasized. Focus on how well information is presented, organized, and detailed rather than whether it is factually accurate."
  bias_considerations: "Evaluate based on information presentation quality, not agreement with evaluator's perspectives"
  context_sensitivity: "Consider the specific question/task context when evaluating appropriateness of detail and coverage"

Each critic, regardless of their specific focus (Coverage, Depth, Style, or Instruction Following), independently arrived at a score of 0/100. This absolute agreement stems from the fundamental issue that the 'Answer being evaluated' was completely blank. There was no content, no text, and no information provided whatsoever. Consequently, no aspect of the answer could be positively evaluated against any criteria. The aggregation process did not involve averaging or resolving discrepancies, but rather affirming the universal judgment that a blank response cannot fulfill any evaluative dimension.",
